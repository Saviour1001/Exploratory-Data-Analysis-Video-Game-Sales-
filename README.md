# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Video-Game-Sales-
Explored the sales of Video games of various consoles dating from 1980 - 2016 and analysed the nature of different spectrums such as popularity of Genre, Country and Gaming Platforms over the time period.

I was able to analyse the data collected over years via the use of Pandas. The dataset required some cleaning and preparation which was done with the help of the the library. Later the glowing colours of Matlplot lib and Seaborn were there to make the jupyter notebook glowing. 

Enjoyed finding fascinating facts about the video games sales across different regions of the world and how the genres of popularity changed over the time.Look out for the final graphs which depict everything visually and make it much easier to understand.

Created a fancy word art at the end of the notebook in order to give it the final touch up. Used my learnings from the course Zero to Pandas provided by Jovian and freeCodeCamp mentored by Aakash NS.
